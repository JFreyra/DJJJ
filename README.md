## Data set
1. [Duration of Daylight/Darkness Table for One Year](http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/Dur_OneYear.php)
2. Data set includes the durations of daylight/darkness throughout a given year (1700 - 2100) in a given city.
3. Data set can illustrate the relationship between duration of daylight/darkness and seasonal affective disorder(SAD)

## Approach
1. Use bar graph to represent the durations of daylight/darkness
2. Background brightness changes according to the duration of daylight/darkness
3. Clicking on a bar of the year brings up a daylight graph/curve for that specific day
4. Could be related to seasonal depression to explain what it is, when it usually hits, and its effects

## Visualisation
1. Bars represent a day within a year
2. Height represents the hours of sunlight in the day
3. Nice graphics in the background make the graphic nice (possibly dynamic graphics)
4. Clicking on a bar will create an instance of a graph of the day chosen, possibly will denote sunrise, sunset, implement data of what people do on a day to day basis from [the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/07/31/business/20080801-metrics-graphic.html?_r=0)
