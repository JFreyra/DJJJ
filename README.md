## Data set
1. [Duration of Daylight/Darkness Table for One Year](http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/Dur_OneYear.php)
2. Data set includes the durations of daylight/darkness throughout a given year (1700 - 2100) in a given city.
3. Data set can illustrate the relationship between duration of daylight/darkness and seasonal affective disorder(SAD)

## Approach
1. Use bar graph to represent the durations of daylight/darkness
2. Background brightness changes according to the duration of daylight/darkness
